# RetroVideozMVC

This project was developed during my last four weeks at Eleven Fifty Academy. It is an e-commerce app that allows users to buy videos sold on the website. 
Additionally, users can rate and post reviews to videos as well. Finally, users can add videos to the database, however, future updates will restrict this feature to admin access only.

# Updates
Due to time constraints and my beginner-level coding skills, there are features that have not been implemented yet. 
Expect more updates to come in the near future as this is a huge passion project of mine
